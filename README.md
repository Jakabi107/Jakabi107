### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jakob. Aka. Jakabi \(Jakob is never available in any online account names!!\). As you may have read from the Bio I'm currently writting software as a hobby and trying to advance my skills as much as I can with self study and several projects. If I get a project \(finsished\) that I think is "publishable" I will upload it here, so maybe sometimes, somehow it could be useful for someone else. However there also may be some started ones not finished or abonded...

My current "skills" compose of:
* basics of OOP \(Java and a little bit C#\)
* a little frontend with Angular and Javascript
* quick scripting with python
* a lot of little intel I don't know how to catogorise or is worth mentioning
