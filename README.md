### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jakob. Aka. Jakabi \(Jakob is never available in any online account names!!\). As you may have read in the Bio I'm currently writting software as a hobby and trying to advance my skills as much as I can with self study! If I get a project \(finsished\) that I think is "publishable" I will upload it here, so maybe sometimes, somehow it could be useful for someone else. However there also may be some started ones, not finished or abonded...ðŸ™ƒ

---

__My current "skills" compose of: ðŸ”­__
* OOP \(Java and a little bit C#\)
* a little Frontend with Angular and Javascript
* quick scripting with python
* a lot of little intel I don't know how to catogorise or isn't worth mentioning


<br>
If you want help in some projekts, just contact me. I'm always happy to collaborate as I can learn from new things and just like coding in general!
